Caucuses allow delegates to work together in smaller groups, either informally or formally, to address specific aspects of a resolution, propose amendments, or negotiate solutions to problems.a</h4>

                    A moderated caucus is a formal debate on particular subjects that might be of interest to the committee as a whole:<ul>
                    <li>Speaking time  is the allocated amount of time for each delegate to address the committee on a given topic, cannot exceed the limits set by the executive board.</li><li> It is usually 30-90 seconds per speaker.
                    Total time: is the overall amount of time provided for discussion of the specified topic.</li>
                    <li>Raising a motion for a mod cauc:</li><ol>
                    <li>Step 1 – rise your placard, and wait to be addressed by the EB.</li>
                    <li>Step 2 – After being addressed rise a motion saying – MOTION TO ENTER MODERATED CAUCUS </li>
                    <li>Step 3 – if passed by the chair’s discussion, then name the topic of the moderated caucus and give the no. of speakers and the time allotted to each speaker</li>
                    <li>Ex : 16/1 which means there will be 16 delegates speaking and the time for each speaker is 1 minute</li>
                    <li>The committee will vote on each motion and it will need a simple majority to pass. A moderated caucus shall end when there are no more delegates who wish to speak on the subject at hand, regardless of the remaining time</li></ol>
                    <ul><li> Way to move committee into a certain direction </li>

                <li>Delegates are not needed to speak in a formal manner or with the Chairperson’s approval when participating in an Unmoderated Caucus.</li>

                <li>No decorum (but you are marked)</li>

                <li>Keep an underhand on negotiation </li>
                <li>If the EB believes there is no longer any worthwhile discussion, they may also quickly adjourn an unmoderated caucus. </li>
                <li>How to enter an unmoderated caucus (if the floor for motions is open) </li>
                <li>Step 1 – rise your placard, and wait to be addressed by the EB. </li>
                <li>Step 2 - After being addressed rise a motion saying – MOTION TO ENTER UNMODERATED CAUCUS and specify the time (no need to specify topic as the committee can discuss any topic of their choice) Ex: 30 minutes </li>
                <li>Step 3 – if passed by the chair’s discussion, the committee will officially enter into informal session or unmoderated caucus.</li>
